## Tennis Kata

Write logic to manage display on the scoreboard for given situation.

1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least 4 points in total and at least 2 points more than the opponent.
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from 0 to 3 points are described as "Love", "Fifteen", "Thirty", and "Forty" respectively.
3. If at least 3 points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is "Deuce".
4. If at least 3 points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent, the score of the game is "Advantage" for the player in the lead.

You need only report the score for the current game. Sets and Matches are out of scope.
